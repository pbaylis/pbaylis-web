<p>NOTE TO SELF: This is in draft mode right now because I just update my CV automatically. I can make it look nicer and show exactly what I want. Automated updating has not proven to be worth the effort.</p>
<p>I don’t enjoy updating my CV, and I <em>really</em> don’t enjoy updating multiple versions of my CV. To miinimize some of this pain, I’m always on the lookout for ways to automate this process. This post covers my current process and alternatives I’m considering. This is a work in progress, so I don’t have a better version of the current process yet, but I’ve written this post in part for myself so that I can remember what I’ve tried (since I inevitably forget about this project whenever more compelling tasks come along and won’t return to it until 3-4 months later).</p>
<div id="current-version" class="section level1">
<h1>Current version</h1>
<p>The current version of how I do this can be found in this GitHub <a href="https://github.com/pbaylis/baylis-CV">repo</a>. In short, it uses a makefile and multiple runs of <code>pandoc</code> (with custom templates) to create both my <a href="/pdf/Baylis_CV.pdf">CV</a> (a PDF) and my <a href="/research">research</a> page.</p>
<p>But I’m still not fully satisfied with it. What is it missing?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Because of a <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/2335">limitation</a> in <code>pandoc-citeproc</code>, I can’t use the LaTeX <code>\fullcite</code> command to automatically include publications in a way that would also allow me to list related items (links to working paper, media, et cetera) below. This means that when I add a new publication, I have to manually input all of the relevant fields.</li>
<li>Potential inconsistency in citation style.</li>
<li>PDF creation can be ugly: because this is an automated process, I’m finding that sometimes weird page breaks occur in my CV.</li>
<li>Unable to easily show-hide abstract. This could in principle be fixed within the current setup, but it would require more manual work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because of all of this, I don’t update very often. However, I have yet to find a perfect alternative.</p>

<h1>Alternative A: RefManageR</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ropensci/RefManageR">RefManageR</a> is a package that facilitates R interaction with bibliography files. The example below borrows from their <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.2036v1.pdf">vignette</a>, but it’s easy enough to read in <code>.bib</code> files and print their citations.</p>

<p>This is a good start, but I ran into issues when trying to incoporate this into, say, a markdown list that could also include other information for each citation. I’m sure there’s a way to do it, but I wasn’t willing to invest the time since it seemed like it might require quite a bit of manual work.</p>

<div id="alternative-b-vitae" class="section level1">
<h1>Alternative B: Vitae</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ropenscilabs/vitae">vitae</a> is a relatively new package designed for exactly this task. I could (probably) get exactly what I want by setting up some custom <code>vitae</code> templates. Since most of the issues are with creating <code>research.md</code>, I could even start by focusing on that. Why haven’t I done this yet?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The package is a little intimidating, and it seems like it might take me a lot of time to get everything figured out.</li>
<li>I’m not 100% certain this will work, even if I do put in a lot of work.</li>
<li>vitae is still under development, so some of what I do could become obsolete.</li>
<li>With R, there are often better/more elegant solutions showing up every few months or so.</li>
</ol>
