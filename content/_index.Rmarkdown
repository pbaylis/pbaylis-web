I'm an assistant professor and environmental economist at the [Vancouver School of Economics](http://economics.ubc.ca/) and a member of the [Centre for Food, Resource and Environmental Economics](https://cfree.landfood.ubc.ca/) (CFREE). I study how people respond to environmental threats like climate change, air pollution, and wildfires.

Some of my recent [work](/research/) includes estimating the impact of temperature on tweets to understand preferences for climate change, assessing the implicit subsidy of federal wildfire suppression, projecting how climate change will alter peak electricity demand, and considering how consumers respond to defaults in electricity consumption. My favorite projects use large datasets, natural language processing, spatial information, or all three; as a result, I do most of my data work in [R](https://www.r-project.org)/[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) and [Python](https://www.python.org).

Before I joined UBC, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [Stanford Center on Food Security and the Environment](http://fse.fsi.stanford.edu/), a graduate student in [Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC-Berkeley](http://areweb.berkeley.edu), and a research assistant at the [Energy Institute at Haas](https://ei.haas.berkeley.edu).
