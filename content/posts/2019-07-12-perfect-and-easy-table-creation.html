<p>There is no perfect solution to generating regression tables. Here are my unorganized notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>huxtable is (probably) the best solution for generating quick regression tables for export to Markdown or HTML. But it makes ugly LaTeX code and doesn’t play nice with booktabs. Customization is kind of an issue.</li>
<li>stargazer is (probably) the best solution for generating quick regression tables for export to LaTeX, but customization is a nightmare.
<ul>
<li>Doesn’t deal well with trying to have different variables from different models (say, instrumented and non-instrument models) display under the same label.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>kable/kableExtra are great for general purpose table creation, but can’t easily process fitted model output.</li>
</ul>
