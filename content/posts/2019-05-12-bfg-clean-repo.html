<p>I’m frequently finding myself at the limits of my GitHub LFS storage space. Here’s how I use <a href="https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/">BFG</a> to do that. The following code clones a bare repo, drops anything bigger than 10m in the history, and pushes the update to GitHub.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>git clone --mirror git://example.com/some-big-repo.git
java -jar bfg.jar --strip-blobs-bigger-than 10M some-big-repo.git
cd some-big-repo.git
git reflog expire --expire=now --all &amp;&amp; git gc --prune=now --aggressive
git push</code></pre>
<p>To run this, you need to know which repo is eating up your LFS storage. That’s actually not straightforward, since (as far as I can tell) there’s no quick way to see the storage for all of your repos.</p>
